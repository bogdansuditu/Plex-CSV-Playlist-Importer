## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the values:

```env
PLEX_URL=http://plex:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=changeme
DEFAULT_MUSIC_SECTION=Music
DEFAULT_REPLACE_PLAYLIST=true
APP_PORT=8080
MATCH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=70
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

Key variables:

- `PLEX_URL` / `PLEX_TOKEN`: Plex server endpoint and auth token.
- `DEFAULT_MUSIC_SECTION`: Library section name as shown in Plex.
- `DEFAULT_REPLACE_PLAYLIST`: Default checkbox state for replacing playlists.
- `MATCH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`: RapidFuzz acceptance score (0â€“100).
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Console verbosity (file logging always runs at DEBUG).
- `APP_PORT`: Exposed FastAPI port.

All logs stream to `logs/importer.log` on the host.

---

## Running Locally (Recommended on macOS)

```bash
# Clone / unpack repo, then
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # edit values afterwards
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${APP_PORT:-8080}
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` to experience the beautiful Plex-inspired interface. Upload or paste your CSV, review the live preview, then create your playlist with real-time progress tracking.

To stop: `Ctrl+C` followed by `deactivate`.

---

## Running via Docker

> Note: Docker Desktop on macOS may not reach host-only / VPN networks (e.g. Tailscale). Prefer native execution if your Plex server lives on that network.

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # set real Plex values
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Once the container is healthy, the app is available on `http://localhost:${APP_PORT}`.

Container logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f web
```

To tear down:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Usage Workflow

1. **Upload / paste CSV** â€“ Accepts `.csv`/`.txt`. Required headers: `Artist name`, `Track name`. Optional `Album` is used to improve match scores.
2. **Preview + edit** â€“ The textarea shows the canonical form (`Artist name,Album,Track name`). Edit, add, or remove rows as needed.
3. **Configure playlist** â€“ Override Plex URL/token, select the target music library from the dropdown, set playlist name, and optionally replace an existing playlist.
4. **Import** â€“ Submit to trigger fuzzy matching and playlist creation/update. Results page summarises matches, additions, and unmatched items; unmatched rows list original metadata and reasons.
5. **Debug if needed** â€“ Check `logs/importer.log` for row-level parsing decisions, RapidFuzz scores, and Plex API activity.

## Design Philosophy

The interface has been completely redesigned to **match Plex's visual identity**:

### **Authentic Plex Experience**
- **Color Palette**: Deep blacks and grays with Plex's signature Gamboge (`#e5a00d`) accent
- **Typography**: Clean system fonts with proper hierarchy and spacing
- **Visual Elements**: Gradient cards, subtle shadows, and smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful on desktop and mobile devices

### **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Sectioned Interface**: Clear organization of server connection, library selection, and import data
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live track counting, animated progress bars, and status indicators
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Icons, colors, and spacing guide users through the workflow
- **Success Celebrations**: Beautiful results page with statistics and detailed reporting

## Implementation Notes

- **CSV parsing**: `app/services/csv_loader.py` uses pandas with automatic delimiter detection, trims whitespace, and filters down to the required columns. The same module serialises the canonical preview table.
- **Fuzzy search**: `TrackMatcher` normalises text using Unidecode, strips common noise (`feat.`, remaster tags), and scores candidates with `fuzz.WRatio`. Album similarity contributes to tie-breaking when available.
- **Plex coordination**: `PlaylistImporter` deduplicates by `ratingKey`, skips items lacking playable media, and allows replace-or-append semantics.
- **Design System**: Custom Tailwind CSS configuration with Plex color tokens, gradient utilities, and animation classes defined in `base.html`.
- **Logging**: `app/main.py` attaches console + file handlers up front; DEBUG traces (including individual match scores and parsing skips) are written to `logs/importer.log`.
- **Preview endpoint**: `/preview` shares the same parsing pipeline as imports to guarantee consistency between what you edit and what gets submitted.

---

## Testing Checklist

- Upload a CSV with the expected headers and verify the textarea preview matches `Artist name,Album,Track name`.
- Toggle "Replace existing playlist" to confirm append vs replace behaviour.
- Inspect `logs/importer.log` after imports for unmatched rows and RapidFuzz scores.
- Validate Docker deployment only if your Plex server is routable from the container runtime; otherwise prefer native execution.

---

## Future Enhancements

- CSV export of unmatched rows for downstream editing.
- Batch playlist imports per file.
- Auth layer for the UI (Plex SSO, OAuth, etc.).
- API endpoints returning JSON reports for automated workflows.
